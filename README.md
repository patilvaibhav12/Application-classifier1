# Application-classifier
Application Classifier is filter the data of all eligible candidates for cloud counselage pvt. ltd. internship program.

# Analysis Module :
In this module  I have Analyse the data using **MatplotLib**.
## Program Files of analysis are as follows:
1. [Visualization.py](https://github.com/patilvaibhav12/Application-classifier1/blob/master/visualization.py) :: It is a python file which create a pdf of analysis graphs.
2. [students.ipynb](https://github.com/patilvaibhav12/Application-classifier1/blob/master/students.ipynb) :: It is jupyter notebook file of program.


### Some graphs are as follows:

1. No. of students applied for different technologies

2. Year-wise and area of study wise classification of students

3. Students who appied for data Science (knows python and don't know  python)

# Classification module :
In classification module I have used **Support vector clustering Algorithm** to classify and predict the data.
**svc** :: SVC is a nonparametric clustering algorithm that does not make any assumption on the number or shape of the clusters in the data. In our experience it works best for low-dimensional data, so if your data is high-dimensional, a preprocessing step, e.g. using principal component analysis, is usually required. Several enhancements of the original algorithm were proposed that provide specialized algorithms for computing the clusters by only computing a subset of the edges in the adjacency matrix.


## Program Files of Classification are as follows:
1. [Visualization.py](https://github.com/patilvaibhav12/Application-classifier1/blob/master/classifier.py) :: A python file.
2. [students.ipynb](https://github.com/patilvaibhav12/Application-classifier1/blob/master/classifier.ipynb) :: It is jupyter notebook file of program.

## Classification Report ::
This Module has accurracy score of more than 91%.
